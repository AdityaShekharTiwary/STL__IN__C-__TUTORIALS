Hello Everyone ! Welcome to this tutorial where i'll explain the basics of one of the most important concept in CPP used in competitive programming i.e. the STL library or the Standard Template library . So without wasting more time lets begin the journey!!

STL consitis of three components
1) Container
2) Iterator 
3) Algorithm

To Store the data we have the container.
Iterator helps us to move in the Container.
Alogrithm remains the same i.e. there's nothing new in algoritm.

So, here's some basic concepts of STL. Now lets dive in the coding part !!
